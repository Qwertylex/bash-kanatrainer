# Alex's Bash Kanatrainer
It shows you a random kana and asks you what its romaji counterpart is.

## Todo
* ~~Not showing the same kana twice.~~
* ~~Show user summary/score when kana list is exhausted.~~
* ~~Show summary/score on ^C.~~
* Add more kana.
* Maybe split kana into subgroups and let the user train in the kana subgroup of his or her choosing.
* Add comments.
