#Alex's Bash Kanatrainer
##Intro
It shows you a random kana and asks you what its romaji counterpart is.

Its a bit hackish but it works.
I plan to clean it up a bit then make it 1.0 once I think its "clean".

##Todo
* Not show the same kana twice.
* Show user summary/score when kana list is exhausted.
* Maybe split kana into groups and let the user train in the group of his or her choosing.
* Add comments.
